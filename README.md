Cloud computing can be a useful tool to analyse biosignals; when that methodology is combined with over-the-air transfer of data, it allows healthcare providers to access relevant information on a lightweight mobile interface. Here, we develop an Android application that receives an ECG signal over Bluetooth, plots the data stream, and allows a user to send a biosignal analysis request to determine if any abnormality is present in the ECG signal. The application can receive the result of the analysis within seconds of time, allowing healthcare providers to efficiently analyse incoming data.
