Cloud computing can be a useful tool to analyze biosignals; when that methodology is combined with over-the-air transfer of data, it allows healthcare providers to access relevant information on a lightweight mobile interface. Here, we develop an Android application that receives an ECG signal over Bluetooth, plots the data stream, and allows a user to send a biosignal analysis request to determine if there is any abnormality in the ECG signal. The application can receive the analysis result within seconds, allowing healthcare providers to analyze incoming data efficiently.
In this project, we used previously described processes with a new interface to analyze ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database in MATLAB. This was done by connecting a user viaan  Android application to a server capable of applying the Pan-Tompkin algorithm to find the P, Q, R, S, and T waves of an ECG signal. The server can  extract the features of the processed waves and use them as inputs of a supervised machine learning algorithm. We implemented this Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn the characteristics of normal and abnormal heartbeats from the morphological features of the extracted waves.
